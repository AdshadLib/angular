Welcome to the first lesson in this AngularJS course! 

The course consists of a mixture of written content, like this, and interactive code exercises that will help you cement your knowledge. You can just do the course for the exercises, if all you want is to assess your skills.

The Angular concepts you'll be introduced to during the rest of this course include: 

* Modules
* Dependency injection
* Controllers
* Scopes
* The $http service
* Views
