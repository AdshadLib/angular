###Content needed

Most of the content on tagtree is done by one guy, <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikswan">@hendrikswan</a>. The background content for each exercise takes a massive amount of time to create, and it can be done by anyone, including you.

The background content you see here for each exercise lives in a github repo, which you can contribute to using a github pull request. Make this exercise friendlier and get some exposure by contributing to tagtree!

This exercise is about using ng-repeat to bind a view to an array on scope, and the content will need to explain that.

Please expand on the examples used in the previous exercises.
